## Introduction

Extracting information from ID cards is a common requirement in various applications such as identity verification, user onboarding, and automated form filling. This project aims to automate the extraction of information from ID cards, making the process faster and more accurate.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

The main script for extracting information is `main.py`. You can run this script to process an image of an ID card and extract information such as name, ID number, and other details.

### Running the script

1. Place the images of the ID cards you want to process in the `sources` directory.

2. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

3. The extracted information will be saved in the `output` directory or printed to the console, depending on your implementation.

### Example

To extract information from a specific ID card image:

```sh
python main.py --image sources/id_card_image.jpg
